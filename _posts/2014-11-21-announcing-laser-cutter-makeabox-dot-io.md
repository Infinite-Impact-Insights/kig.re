<h1>Announcing LaserCutter ruby gem and MakeABox.IO web site!</h1>

I've been too damn busy with life, universe, and everything, and in the cracks of things forgot to mention and properly introduce to life [LaserCutter](https://github.com/kigster/laser-cutter) – a ruby gem for automatically laying out PDF for cutting boxes using laser cutter.  The gem provides a command line tool that will generate your pretty PDFs based on your entered box dimensions.

In addition to the ruby gem, I put together a very simple Rails front-end called [MakeABox.IO](http://makeabox.io/), which allows you to generate boxes without installing any gem or running anything on the command line.

If you've made any enclosures of your own, you probably used one of the existing / free tools out there. I did not find them all at once, but over the time the choice seems to come down to:

* [Rahulbotics BoxMaker](https://github.com/rahulbot/boxmaker), which last I checked seems like it was taken down.  But the source code remains.  I used this tool to create about a dozen of my first laser-cut boxes ever.
  * Note that Adam Phelps has a sligtly better fork.
* [MakerCase](http://www.makercase.com/) – probably the most advanced online tool I've seen, even with visual preview, but I have not actually made any boxes with it.
* [Tabbed Box Maker – A plugin for InkScape](http://www.keppel.demon.co.uk/111000/111000.html)
