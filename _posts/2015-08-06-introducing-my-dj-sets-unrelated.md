– So, did you know? 

```c++
if (my.question.style_of(blog.post.style) == FALSE) {
  omg() || exit() || return; || run(SUPER_FAST);
}
```

Me: 
– "So, are you prepared to listen to some music?"

You:
– "What the hell are you talking about, this is Electronics Blog, and I came here to read about my goddamn chip that's not working... You are breaking my brain!!!"

Me:
– "I knew you would love it! Then let's begin :)"

You:
– "Grrrrr...."

```c++

If you've been reading this blog for a while, you know it's a personal blog of Konstantin Gredeskoul, the guy with the longest name ever. Why do I have such a name? Well, I was born in Ukraine, but in the western side that spoke Russian as the daily language. Konstantin, often shortened as "Kostya", is a popular name in Russia and Ukraine, so that's not a surprise that I have that first name. However, Gredeskoul, is a rather unique last name, with only a few surviving Gredeskouls in Russia and Ukraine, and only a couple living outside (me and my mom). __Gredeskoul__ is a last name with origins in Moldova, which culturally is closest to Romania.  And if you try to think of a few famous Romanian last names, perhaps you will come up with a list of folks such as such as Popescu, Dumitrescu, Paulescu, Constantinescu, etc – they do have some similarity in sound.  So I believe that Gredeskoul is a bastardized version of some Romanian name, something like Gredescu, which happens to exist. See, for example [this football player](http://www.maxpreps.com/athlete/vladimir-gredescu/tB3mwfTtEeKZ5AAmVebBJg/default.htm).

So, now you see that having such a long name for quite some time now, I welcome any opportunity to shorten it. 

So whenever I have to "re-" name myself, perhaps for a new "stage name", each time I had a chance to pick something shorter. So with that....

In addition to the __kig__ (my initials in __Kiguino__, the name of the blog), I have two additional music-related personalities:

  1. One is called __[LeftCtrl](https://soundcloud.com/leftctrl)__ and is my DJ name.  Anytime I DJ at a party, this is what I use.  
  2. My very old DJ name used to be __djzeel__ about 15 years ago (famous in Australia, where I played a string of gigs across most clubs, having been DJ-ing only for about 2 months total at the time LOL)
  3. Finally, I wrote and produced a bunch of tracks... 
     * First the stage name was ["PolyVinyl"](https://soundcloud.com/polygroovers/without-polyvinyl?in=polygroovers/sets/the-best-of-polygroovers), and produced a single album "Inward Journeys", unreleased.
     * Following me meeting my second wife, together we produced enough tracks for [two downtempo albums as PolyGroovers](https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/polygroovers/id160976572), also available on [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/polygroovers). So, my wife at the time – Telene – sang on most of the vocal tracks with two exceptions, and is also a fantastic DJ with her own SoundCloud page – [Telene](https://soundcloud.com/telene).

And, thanks to SoundCloud embedded widgets, I can now put them all into this thing called *embed*. What that means, I have no idea, but I am guessing they are just sticking it in. Somewhere. Somehow ;-)
