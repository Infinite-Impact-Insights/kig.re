:page-excerpt: Docker enables developers to easily pack, ship, and run any application as a lightweight, portable, self-sufficient container, which can run virtually anywhere. Containers gives you instant application portability. In this post we explore why Docker is so popular, and which innovations make it stand out.

I started building distributed applications in 1996 when I was placed as a junior contractor in the operations group managing a very large-scale project. The goal was to rebuild the entire messaging and cargo tracking software for the Australian Railway Corporation named aptly https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Rail_Corporation[National Rail Corporation].  Back then, we used this fascinating commercial software called https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuxedo_(software)[Tuxedo]  as middleware, transaction manager, a queueing system, and so much more. Tuxedo has a fascinating history -- which could be a subject of an entirely separate post, but suffice it to say that it was developed by AT&T in the late 1970s, in a practically the same lab as UNIX itself! At some point in the 80s, it was then sold to Novell, then to BEA -- which eventually used it to build it's flagship product http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/middleware/weblogic/overview/index-085209.html[WebLogic] that now belongs to Oracle. I was told that there was a time where British Airways used Tuxedo to network over 20,000 stations together.

This is where I learned how to build distributed applications -- with tenets such as _high availability, fault tolerance, load balancing, transactional queueing, distributed transactions_ spanning several databases, plus several queues. Oh my gosh, if it sounds complicated -- it' because it was! But once you get the main concepts behind how Tuxedo was constructed: each node had a server process that communicated with other nodes, and managed a local pool of services -- it sounds very reasonable. I stayed on this project for about a year and a half, long enough that all of the most senior people who understood the messaging component had left, leaving me -- 23-year-old junior programmer, the only person understanding the architecture and operational aspect of that system. That part of the waterfall was not predicted by their project managers â˜º.

Imagine being flown on a corporate helicopter across the gorgeous city of Sydney, just to attend the meeting with people five levels senior to explain how the multi-million dollar messaging infrastructure works :)  That was a good day.

=== Distributing Email in San Francisco

I took my knowledge of distributed systems to the US, where I was hired to build Topica, a hot new startup in San Francisco creating a new generation of listservs, or email groups (aka. mailing lists). The year was 1998, and there sure wasn't any open source distributed networking software that gave us the incredible reliability and versatility that the middleware like Tuxedo provided, so we bought a license. Whether this was the right choice for the company as at time is not for me to judge. But the system we built ended up using Tuxedo (ANSI C with Tuxedo SDK), Perl (with native bindings for C), and horizontally distributed Oracle databases. This beast ended up being so damn scalable that at a point in time someone mentioned Topica as a source of more than 1% of *all daily internet* at that time! And sure enough, we were sending several hundred million messages per day.

And here is a kicker: if you open https://app.topica.com/[app.topica.com] you will see the login screen from the app we built -- it's functionality is most similar to that of http://www.constantcontact.com/[Constant Contact]. The Topica app has been running untouched, seemingly unmodified, since 2004! -- Twelve years! They stopped developing the app shortly after I left in 2004, mostly for business reasons. But the software endured. And it's still running, 12 years later.  It was built to be reliable. It was scalable. It was transactional. What it wasn't -- is simple.

This second experience with Tuxedo forever changed the way I approach distributed application development.
