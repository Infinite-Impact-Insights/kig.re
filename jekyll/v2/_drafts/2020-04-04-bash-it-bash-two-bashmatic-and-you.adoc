:page-excerpt: "BASH — we love it, we hate it, but more often than not - we use it. Should we keep using it? Replace it with something else? Adopt Google BASH Style Guide? Write BASH so obfuscated that nobody understands it, even you? In this post we explore the state of BASH, and long the way introduce more than a couple nifty BASH frameworks. Go ahead, read on. It won't bash your head, but it will help your BASH it later :)"
