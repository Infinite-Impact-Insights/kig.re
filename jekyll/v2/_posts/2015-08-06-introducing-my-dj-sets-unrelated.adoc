== Foray into DJ-ing, Music Production, and More...

If you've been reading this blog for a while, you know it's a personal blog of Konstantin Gredeskoul, the guy with the longest name ever. Why do I have such a name? Well, I was born in Ukraine, but in the western side that spoke Russian as the daily language. Konstantin, often shortened as "Kostya", is a popular name in Russia and Ukraine, so that's not a surprise that I have that first name. However, Gredeskoul, is a rather unique last name, with only a few surviving Gredeskouls in Russia and Ukraine, and only a couple living outside (me and my mom). *Gredeskoul* is a last name with origins in Moldova, which culturally is closest to Romania.  And if you try to think of a few famous Romanian last names, perhaps you will come up with a list of folks such as Popescu, Dumitrescu, Paulescu, Constantinescu, etc -- they do have some similarity in sound.  So I believe that Gredeskoul is a bastardized version of some Romanian name, something like Gredescu, which happens to exist. See, for example http://www.maxpreps.com/athlete/vladimir-gredescu/tB3mwfTtEeKZ5AAmVebBJg/default.htm[this football player].

So, now you see that having such a long name for quite some time now, I welcome any opportunity to shorten it.

So whenever I have to "re-" name myself, perhaps for a new "stage name", each time I had a chance to pick something shorter. So with that....

In addition to the *kig* (my initials in *Kiguino*, the name of the blog), I have two additional music-related personalities:

. One is called *https://soundcloud.com/leftctrl[LeftCtrl]* and is my DJ name.  Anytime I DJ at a party, this is what I use.

. My very old DJ name used to be *djzeel* about 15 years ago (famous in Australia, where I played a string of gigs across several top clubs in Melbourne, having been DJ-ing only for about 2 months total at the time, but being very successful at marketing myself to club owners, as a "DJ From San Francisco".  Imagine that, in 1998 that + a tape actually got you paid gigs :-)
. Finally, I wrote and produced a bunch of tracks...

 ** First the stage name was https://soundcloud.com/polygroovers/without-polyvinyl?in=polygroovers/sets/the-best-of-polygroovers["PolyVinyl"], and produced a single album "Inward Journeys", unreleased.
 ** Following me meeting my second wife, together we produced enough tracks for https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/polygroovers/id160976572[two downtempo albums as PolyGroovers], also available on https://soundcloud.com/polygroovers[SoundCloud]. So, my wife at the time -- Telene -- sang on most of the vocal tracks with two exceptions, and is also a fantastic DJ with her own SoundCloud page -- https://soundcloud.com/telene[Telene].

And, thanks to SoundCloud embedded widgets, I can now put them all into this thing called _embed_. What that means, I have no idea, but I am guessing they are just sticking it in. Somewhere. Somehow ;-)
