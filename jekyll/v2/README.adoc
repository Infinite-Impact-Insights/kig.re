= Jekyll kig.re Site v2

:icons: font

== Usage:

=== Generating the Static Site Manually:

[source,bash]
----
npm install
gulp build
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll build
----

Serve from `_site` folder.

=== Automated Way via `rake`

We've put together a bunch of useful Rake tasks for all of your needs.

==== Static Site Generation

[source,bash]
----
bundle install
bundle exec rake jekyll:generate
----

==== Live Editing

[source,bash]
----
$ bundle install && bundle exec rake
----

The task being executed by the default is `jekyll:preview`, which runs `jekyll:serve` and `jekyll:browser`. The later one opens the browser after the assets are compiled, but it's not an exact science.

The main Rake task `jekyll:serve` starts two long-running child processes:

* `gulp watch`
* `bundle exec jekyll serve --watch --trace`

This will live-recompile all static assets, so that you can see what you get.

You can Ctrl-C to shut it down.

Enjoy!

==== Faster Reload

While running `rake` will install all dependencies, it does take some 30 seconds to run even when things are already built recently.

For this reason there is another task:

[source,bash]
bundle exec rake jekyll:watch

Which starts both Jekyll in a "watch" mode, as well as Gulp in the watch mode.
