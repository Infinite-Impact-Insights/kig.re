This is a sort of a summary section from a resume, without giving super complete details. However, the full details are a click away on Linked In (see below).

### Availability

I am currently looking for a part-time engagement, three days a week, within San Francisco City limits (or telecommuting).

## Background

I am a seasoned technology executive, software architect, entrepreneur, and a former CTO of three VC funded companies. As a technology leader for nearly ten years, I drove vision, culture, process, and strategy within engineering organizations. My teams learn to focus on business value, amplifying the bottom line and continually increasing product value.

I am used to working either within or in close cooperation with the founding or executive team. I get particularly excited when I have a chance to provide feedback into the initial product roadmap, leading "inceptions" meetings where an idea gets broken down into a set of implementable stories, which, in turn, can be estimated. I love helping existing teams with improving efficiency, trust, and the engineering process. I am a big proponent and implementer of modern software engineering practices that make software teams strong, incredibly productive and happy: such as test-driven development, pair-programming, continuous deployment, and infrastructure transparency.

The concepts of micro-services architectures and DevOps have been my focus for over a decade, and across six different engineering teams. Before that I specialized in designing and deploying highly available, fault tolerant, highly concurrent distributed transactional systems, such as an email delivery platform that was sending about 1% of the entire Internet's email volume in 1999.

I advocate for incremental but continuing investment in making software adaptable, (i.e. easy to change and maintain), highly performant, and possible to scale horizontally across commodity hardware (or a cloud). I love operational transparency in the production, powered by full automation, comprehensive monitoring, and intelligent alerting that uses business metrics to decide if an alert is worth sending, thus resulting in just a few alerts a week. This approach enables small teams to manage large cloud deployments across any low-cost horizontally scalable infrastructure.

### Current Interests

The following are the areas where my contribution will be most impactful, sorted by how much impact I predict it will be,  highest impact first.

 * substitute/temp CTO/VP Eng/Director of Engineering
