### Professional Summary

I am a seasoned technology executive, software architect, entrepreneur, and a former CTO of three VC funded companies. As a technology leader for nearly ten years, I drove the vision, culture, process, and strategy within engineering organizations. I focus on maximizing the business and product value while staying human and looking after my team.

I am comfortable working either within or in close cooperation with the founding or executive team. I get particularly excited when I have a chance to provide feedback into the initial product roadmap, leading "inceptions" meetings where an idea gets broken down into a set of implementable stories, which, in turn, we can estimate. I love helping existing teams with improving efficiency, trust, and the process. I am a big proponent and implementer of modern software engineering practices that help make software engineering teams incredibly productive and happy. I invest into and believe in practices such as test-driven development, pair-programming, continuous deployment, and infrastructure transparency.

The concepts of micro-services architectures and DevOps have been my focus for over a decade, and across six different engineering teams. Before that, I specialized in designing and deploying highly available, fault tolerant, highly concurrent distributed transactional systems, such as an email delivery platform that was sending about 1% of the entire Internet's email volume in 1999.

I advocate for incremental but continuing investment in making software adaptable, (i.e. easy to change and maintain), highly performant, and possible to scale horizontally across commodity hardware (or a cloud). I love operational transparency in the production, powered by full automation, comprehensive monitoring, and intelligent alerting that uses business metrics to decide if an alert is worth sending, thus resulting in just a few alerts a week. This approach enables small teams to manage large cloud deployments across any low-cost horizontally scalable infrastructure.
